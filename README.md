Over winter break I decided I wanted to code some fun non school related things to keep me sharp for the upcoming semester. 

I kept seeing these bouncing ball simulations used to hold peoples attention on tiktok and wondered how they were made so this collection of python files is just different simulations I see that I attempted to make from scratch. 

Everything was done using python and pygame, pretty simple. I used some knowledge from physics class and calc III to figure out how the balls should react when they collide with objects. 

The eventual goal if I ever get there is to combine everything into one applicaiton where the user can customize how the simulation is set up and be able to overlay it ontop of a video they have so they can upload this to social media. 

If you want to run these you need python and pygame installed on your computer.
