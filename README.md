I kept seeing these bouncing ball simulations used to hold peoples attention on tiktok and wondered how they were made so this collection of python files is just different simulations I see that I attempted to make from scratch. 

Everything was done using python and pygame, pretty simple. I used some knowledge from physics class and calc III to figure out how the balls should react when they collide with objects. 

If you want to run these you need python and pygame installed on your computer.
