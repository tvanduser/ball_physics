I kept seeing these bouncing ball simulations used to hold peoples attention on tiktok and wondered how they were made so this collection of python files is just different simulations I see. 

Everything was done using python and pygame, pretty simple. I used some knowledge from physics class and calc III to figure out how the balls should react when they collide with objects.
